# WebSocket Connection Implementation - Decisions & Next Steps

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Data Model Approach**: 
   - We'll use a unified data model that aligns with the Rust server's structure
   - Client-side `ConnectionData` interface will be compatible with server's `Connection` model
   - We'll keep the local `name` field for UI display purposes but map to the Rust server's player ID structure

2. **Connection Status Handling**:
   - We'll add the `Expired` status to the TypeScript `ConnectionStatus` enum to match the Rust model
   - Final enum will include `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, and `EXPIRED` states

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - We'll continue using the Result pattern but create new API-specific error types
   - This provides clear separation between local storage and network operations
   - New `ApiError` class will include network-specific information (status codes, detailed messages)

4. **Service Architecture**:
   - We'll implement a separate `ConnectionApiService` class for API communication
   - This maintains the rule of keeping code files under 500 lines
   - Existing `ConnectionService` will remain focused on local operations

5. **Real-Time Update Approach**:
   - WebSockets will be used for real-time updates (notifications, connection status changes)
   - This provides better responsiveness and lower overhead than polling

6. **Data Synchronization Strategy**:
   - Server updates will be performed first, followed by local storage updates if successful
   - This ensures local state reflects confirmed server state
   - Avoids complex rollback logic needed for optimistic updates

7. **Authentication Approach**:
   - For the current implementation, the server will trust client-provided player IDs
   - Security considerations will be documented for future review

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Create API Error Types**:
   - Implement `ApiErrorType` enum and `ApiError` class
   - Define mapping between HTTP status codes and error types

2. **Implement ConnectionApiService**:
   - Create new service with methods matching Rust backend endpoints
   - Implement connection creation, joining, and status updates
   - Add proper error handling with the new ApiError types

3. **Add WebSocket Integration**:
   - Implement WebSocket connection management
   - Create message handlers for different event types
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for WebSocket messages

4. **Update ConnectionStatus Enum**:
   - Add `EXPIRED` status to match the Rust implementation
   - Update any UI components that use the enum

5. **Create Data Mapping Logic**:
   - Implement conversion functions between local and server data models
   - Ensure consistent handling of dates, IDs, and status values

6. **Implement Service Synchronization**:
   - Create methods to sync between local storage and server
   - Add logic to update local storage after successful server operations

7. **Update Tests**:
   - Expand test coverage to include API operations
   - Create mock implementations of the API service for testing

8. **Documentation**:
   - Document security considerations
   - Add API service usage examples

These steps provide a clear roadmap for implementing the WebSocket connection integration between the TypeScript client and Rust backend.
