# Prisoner's Dilemma App: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Prisoner's Dilemma application.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core Implementation (Connection UI Components - Red Phase)  
**Current TDD Phase**: RED - Writing tests for Connection UI Components  
**Last Updated**: May 10, 2025

## Project Vision

To create an interactive application that allows friends to play the Prisoner's Dilemma game, learn about game theory, and analyze strategies and outcomes.

## Development Approach

This project follows **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles with a **Red-Green-Refactor** workflow:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior *(CURRENT PHASE)*
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code quality while maintaining passing tests

We've established a **hybrid testing strategy** with:
- **Vitest**: For fast unit testing of logic functions
- **@web/test-runner**: For browser-based component testing

We will commit to making the smallest possible code changes with each iteration, ensuring:
- Every feature is thoroughly tested before implementation
- Code remains clean, maintainable, and follows best practices
- Technical debt is minimized through continuous refactoring
- Development progress is measurable through test coverage

## User Stories

We've created a comprehensive set of [user stories](/prisoners-dilemma-docs/docs/technical/user-stories) to guide our development process. Key user stories include:

- Player registration and local storage functionality
- Connection management between players
- Game initiation and statistics tracking

These user stories are prioritized to ensure we focus on the most important features first. See the full [user stories document](/prisoners-dilemma-docs/docs/technical/user-stories) for details.

## Current Focus: Connection UI Components - Red Phase

We are currently in the **Red Phase** of TDD for connection UI components. This means we are:

1. Writing failing tests that define the expected behavior of our connection components
2. Designing component interfaces and public methods
3. Establishing test patterns for event handling and Result pattern integration
4. Creating comprehensive test suites for each planned component

### Components Being Tested:

1. **Connection Creation Component**:
   - Tests for generating shareable links
   - Tests for error handling using Result pattern
   - Tests for UI state changes based on operation outcomes
   - Tests for accessibility and user interaction

2. **Connection List Component**:
   - Tests for displaying connection lists
   - Tests for empty states and error conditions
   - Tests for custom event dispatching
   - Tests for connection state indicators

3. **Connection Detail Component**:
   - Tests for displaying connection information
   - Tests for status-based UI rendering
   - Tests for operation controls (accept, delete, etc.)
   - Tests for error state handling

4. **Connection Request Component**:
   - Tests for request acceptance and rejection
   - Tests for validation error handling
   - Tests for UI messaging based on request status
   - Tests for Result pattern integration

Each test suite is being designed to:
- Use the Result pattern for operation outcomes
- Leverage Lit's reactive properties for state management
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Test component communication via custom events
- Ensure accessibility requirements are met

Once all tests are written and failing properly (Red phase complete), we'll move to the Green phase to implement the minimal code to make these tests pass.

## Technology Choices

### Build System
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS v4.0 with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Build Scripts**: CommonJS (.cjs) for build-time utilities

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest (for pure logic functions)
- **Component Testing**: @web/test-runner (for browser-based component testing)
- **Test Helpers**: @open-wc/testing for component fixtures and assertions
- **Text Content Testing**: Use `.trim()` for consistent assertions
- **Service Mocking**: Result-based mocks replacing direct values
- **Component State Testing**: Dedicated public test helper methods

### Frontend Technologies
- **Web Components**: Lit with Shadow DOM
- **Best Practices**: Open WC principles (adapted for Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dedicated build script
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage with service abstraction
- **Error Handling**: Result pattern for type-safe error handling
- **State Management**: Lit's reactive properties with Result pattern
- **Component Communication**: Custom events with strongly typed detail
- **UI Error Handling**: Error type-based conditional rendering

### TypeScript Event Handling Pattern

We've established a comprehensive TypeScript pattern for handling custom events in our connection UI components:

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Strongly Typed Custom Events**
   - Interfaces for event detail objects (e.g., `ConnectionEventDetail`)
   - Extended `HTMLElementEventMap` globally to type custom events
   - Defined events: `game-requested`, `connection-created`, `confirm-delete-connection`, `refresh-connections`, `play-with-connection`

2. **Type-Safe Event Handlers**
   - Handlers declared as `EventListener` interface for standard compatibility
   - Implementation uses type assertions for proper type checking
   - Bound handlers stored as class properties for clean lifecycle management

3. **Typed Event Dispatching**
   - Custom events with proper type parameters
   - Events configured with `bubbles: true` and `composed: true` for Shadow DOM compatibility
   - All events include strongly typed detail objects

4. **Event Helper Methods**
   - Generic `fireEvent<T>` method for consistent event dispatching
   - Simplifies event creation while maintaining type safety
   - Reduces boilerplate code across components

```typescript
// Example pattern:
interface ConnectionEventDetail {
  connectionId: string;
  connectionName: string;
}

declare global {
  interface HTMLElementEventMap {
    'game-requested': CustomEvent<ConnectionEventDetail>;
  }
}

protected fireEvent<T>(eventName: string, detail: T): void {
  this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(eventName, {
    detail,
    bubbles: true,
    composed: true
  }));
}
```

### API Selection
We will use the **friends-connect** API for handling player connections. This is a Rust library specifically designed for connecting players in game applications.

**Source**: [github.com/randallard/friends-connect](https://github.com/randallard/friends-connect)

**Description**: A Rust library for connecting with friends to play games, providing the server-side functionality we need for managing connection requests and active connections.

## Open Questions

- What is our target test coverage percentage?
- How will we handle cross-browser compatibility testing?
- Should we automate accessibility testing?
- How will we handle edge cases like connection failures?
- Should we create a centralized error reporting service?
- What metrics should we collect about error frequency and types?
- How do we best balance immutability with performance for complex data structures?
- Should we adopt a dedicated immutability library for more complex state management?

## Next Steps

1. Complete Red Phase for all connection UI component tests
2. Move to Green Phase - implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Enter Refactor Phase - optimize implementation
4. Integrate connection management with game app
5. Begin implementing game mechanics
