# Prisoner's Dilemma App: Project Plan & Status

This document serves as a living record of our project plan, current status, and progress towards completing the Prisoner's Dilemma application.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Initial Planning  
**Last Updated**: April 26, 2025

## Project Vision

To create an interactive application that allows friends to play the Prisoner's Dilemma game, learn about game theory, and analyze strategies and outcomes.

## User Stories

We've created a comprehensive set of [user stories](/docs/technical/user-stories) to guide our development process. Key user stories include:

- Player registration and local storage functionality
- Connection management between players
- Game initiation and statistics tracking

These user stories are prioritized to ensure we focus on the most important features first. See the full [user stories document](/docs/technical/user-stories) for details.

## Core App Functionality

### 1. Game Mechanics
- ⬜ Simple initial version showing "The Game" screen
- ⬜ Display of player names
- ⬜ Counter showing how many times each player has opened the game
- ⬜ *(Future)* Full Prisoner's Dilemma rules and scoring

### 2. Social Features
- ⬜ Connect with friends via shareable links
- ⬜ Maintain a connections list with status indicators
- ⬜ Custom naming of connections

### 3. Data Management
- ⬜ Local storage for all game data
- ⬜ Track game state and history with each connection
- ⬜ Store player preferences
- ⬜ Downloadable backup and restore functionality

### 4. Minimal Viable Product
- ⬜ Players can connect via shareable links
- ⬜ Basic game screen shows player names
- ⬜ Count and display number of game opens per player
- ⬜ Local data persistence

## Development Roadmap

## Key Decisions & Notes

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| April 26, 2025 | Created dedicated project plan page | To maintain a central record of project status and plans |
| April 26, 2025 | Defined initial user stories | To establish clear requirements and development priorities |

## Next Steps

1. Define technical architecture
2. Choose frontend framework
3. Design data model for local storage
4. Create UI wireframes
5. Begin implementation of highest priority user stories

## Open Questions

- Which technology stack will best support our local-first approach?
- Should we prioritize web or mobile development?
- How will we handle offline gameplay?
- What will the server component for connection management look like?
