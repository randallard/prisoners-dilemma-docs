## Workflow comments

Today was a great example of utilizing the following prompt:

"you are an expert in Lit and tailwindcss
ask me questions, waiting for an answer after each, before asking the next, 
until you have enough context to suggest options to fix with high chance of success"

obviously the wording changes a little but the idea is I don't have to get all the context in the first try

This was really effective with both issues in different ways

The look and feel issue [(view the chat)](https://claude.ai/share/575935e3-5625-4189-9b77-4dec19ae2b59) I had attached the files I thought pertinent, then answered a couple questions, and got exactly what I wanted - even better than if I'd given it a go on my own, I realize now, looking back at my initial thoughts.

The websocket connections planning [(view the chat)](https://claude.ai/share/497997ae-27b7-4be7-b3f9-17454a66b3a7) was outstanding in how thorough the questions were to complete the [planning phase]({{ '/docs/technical/websocket-connection' | relative_url }}) - and this was enourmously better than I would have done without ai assistance.

## Current Status

Today's work focused on two main areas: enhancing the UI for the connection copy button and planning the WebSocket connection implementation. For the UI enhancements, we updated the styling of the list item connection copy button to better align with our application's design system. For the WebSocket implementation, we created a detailed plan to handle real-time connections between users.

## UI Enhancement

We made subtle but important improvements to the connection copy button:
- Adjusted the styling to be consistent with our theme variables
- Improved hover and active states for better user feedback
- Ensured proper alignment within the connection list items
- Verified styling in both light and dark modes

These changes improve the overall user experience when managing connection links as implemented in our previous work session.

## WebSocket Connection Planning

### Connection Architecture

We've designed the WebSocket connection architecture with the following components:
- A `WebSocketService` to handle connection establishment and maintenance
- Event-based messaging system using the publish-subscribe pattern
- Connection state management with automatic reconnection logic
- Message serialization/deserialization with error handling

### Key Features Planned

1. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Secure WebSocket connection using authentication tokens
   - Connection state tracking with reconnection attempts
   - Heartbeat mechanism to detect connection issues

2. **Message Handling**:
   - Typed message format for consistency and validation
   - Message routing based on type and content
   - Queue for handling messages during reconnection

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Connection state updates to UI components
   - Service integration for real-time data synchronization
   - Event dispatching for application-wide notifications

### Technical Approach

We will implement the WebSocket connection using:
- Native WebSocket API with wrapper for reconnection logic
- Result pattern for error handling consistent with our existing services
- Custom event system for message distribution
- State management using Lit reactive properties

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Use Custom WebSocket Wrapper

**Context:** Need a reliable WebSocket implementation with reconnection logic.

**Decision:** Create a custom WebSocket wrapper class to handle connection management.

**Rationale:**
- Provides better control over reconnection logic
- Allows for custom event handling
- Simplifies integration with our existing architecture
- Enables better testing through dependency injection

### Decision 2: Adopt Message Type System

**Context:** Need a consistent way to handle different message types.

**Decision:** Implement a type-based message system with handlers registered for specific message types.

**Rationale:**
- Creates a clear separation of concerns
- Enables future extension with new message types
- Simplifies testing of individual message handlers
- Follows established patterns for event-driven systems

## Next Actions

1. Create the `WebSocketService` interface and implementation
2. Implement the connection state management logic
3. Design the message type system and serialization format
4. Create mock implementations for testing
5. Integrate with existing services for real-time updates
6. Update UI components to reflect connection state

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation will follow a test-driven approach:
1. Create failing tests for WebSocket connection establishment
2. Implement the basic connection functionality
3. Add tests for reconnection and state management
4. Expand implementation with error handling and reconnection
5. Create tests for message handling
6. Implement message processing and routing
