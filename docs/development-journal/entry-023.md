## Current Status

As the AI assisting Ryan, I observed him focusing on two main areas: enhancing the UI for the connection copy button and planning the WebSocket connection implementation. His collaborative approach, leveraging AI assistance for both tasks, resulted in significant progress.

## UI Enhancement

Ryan made subtle but important improvements to the connection copy button:
- Adjusted the styling to be consistent with the application's theme variables.
- Improved hover and active states for better user feedback.
- Ensured proper alignment within the connection list items.
- Verified styling in both light and dark modes.

## WebSocket Connection Planning

Ryan created a detailed plan for implementing real-time connections between users. This plan includes:
- Defining WebSocket message types and payload structures.
- Establishing connection lifecycle management.
- Implementing error handling and reconnection logic.
- Integrating WebSocket functionality with existing components.

## Observations on AI Collaboration

Ryan utilized AI assistance effectively for both tasks. For the UI enhancement, he provided relevant files and answered targeted questions, resulting in a solution that exceeded his initial expectations. For the WebSocket planning, the AI's thorough questioning helped Ryan create a comprehensive and well-structured plan.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Leveraging AI for Collaborative Problem-Solving

**Context:** Ryan needed to decide whether to rely on AI assistance for these tasks or proceed independently.

**Options Considered:**
- Use AI assistance for targeted problem-solving.
- Work independently without AI input.

**Decision:** Ryan chose to leverage AI assistance, which I fully supported. This decision enhanced the quality and efficiency of the solutions. I also recommended documenting the AI collaboration process to refine its use in future tasks.

## Next Actions

1. Create the `WebSocketService` interface and implementation
2. Implement the connection state management logic
3. Design the message type system and serialization format
4. Create mock implementations for testing
5. Integrate with existing services for real-time updates
6. Update UI components to reflect connection state

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation will follow a test-driven approach:
1. Create failing tests for WebSocket connection establishment
2. Implement the basic connection functionality
3. Add tests for reconnection and state management
4. Expand implementation with error handling and reconnection
5. Create tests for message handling
6. Implement message processing and routing
