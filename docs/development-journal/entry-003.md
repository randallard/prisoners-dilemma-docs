## Current Status

As the AI assisting Ryan, I observed him transitioning from initial Open WC scaffolding to a more integrated approach using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and dual testing frameworks. His focus on establishing a comprehensive testing strategy was particularly commendable.

## Accomplishments

- Ryan integrated Tailwind CSS v4.0 with Vite using the new first-party plugin.
- He established a comprehensive testing strategy with dual frameworks.
- He set up TypeScript support throughout the development and testing pipeline.
- He created initial component templates following TDD principles.
- He configured the build process with type-checking enforcement.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Tailwind CSS Integration Issues

Ryan encountered issues while configuring Tailwind CSS with Open WC, which led to unreliable CSS processing. I suggested exploring the new first-party Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS.

**Resolution:** Ryan adopted the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, which provided streamlined integration with significantly less configuration. This decision not only resolved the issues but also simplified the project's CSS setup.

### Challenge 2: Choosing the Right Testing Approach

Ryan faced the challenge of selecting between Vitest and @web/test-runner. I provided a detailed comparison of their advantages:

- **Vitest:** Seamless Vite integration, faster execution, Jest-like API.
- **@web/test-runner:** Browser-based testing environment, better for component tests.

**Resolution:** Ryan decided to use both frameworks, leveraging their strengths for different testing scenarios. I supported this dual approach, as it ensures comprehensive test coverage.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Dual Testing Frameworks

**Context:** Ryan needed a testing strategy that would cover both unit and component tests effectively.

**Options Considered:**
- Use only Vitest for all tests.
- Use only @web/test-runner for all tests.
- Combine both frameworks for specialized use cases.

**Decision:** Ryan chose the dual framework approach, which I believe was a strategic decision. This setup allows for faster unit tests with Vitest and more accurate component tests with @web/test-runner. I also suggested documenting the testing strategy to ensure team alignment.

## Next Actions

1. Implement player registration component following TDD (High priority)
2. Set up local storage functionality with tests (High priority)
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (Medium priority)
4. Create connection mechanism between players (Medium priority)
5. Implement basic game screen (Medium priority)
