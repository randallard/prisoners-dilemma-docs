## Current Status

As the AI assisting Ryan, I observed him completing the initial planning and technology selection phase for the Prisoner's Dilemma app. His thorough evaluation of various frameworks and tools demonstrated a meticulous approach to ensuring the project's success.

## Accomplishments

- Ryan conducted a thorough evaluation of web component libraries.
- He selected Lit as the primary web component library.
- He decided to follow Open WC best practices for structure and testing.
- He chose Tailwind CSS for styling.
- He defined an initial component architecture approach.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Selecting the Right Web Component Library

Ryan faced the challenge of choosing between several web component libraries (Lit, Stencil, and a vanilla implementation with Open WC). I provided insights into the performance, community support, and developer experience of each option.

**Resolution:** After careful evaluation, Ryan selected Lit based on its superior reliability, strong community support, and optimal performance characteristics. I supported this decision, noting that Lit's features align well with the project's requirements.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Selecting Lit over Stencil for Web Components

**Context:** Ryan needed a web component library that would provide excellent user experience, good async support, and reliable performance.

**Options Considered:**
- Lit: Reliable, performant, and well-supported.
- Stencil: Offers additional features but with a steeper learning curve.
- Vanilla implementation with Open WC: Lightweight but requires more manual effort.

**Decision:** Ryan chose Lit, and I believe this was the right choice. Its balance of simplicity and power makes it an excellent fit for the project. I also suggested leveraging Lit's strong documentation to accelerate the development process.

**Rationale:** 
- **Strong Community Support**: Lit has more active community development and is backed by Google, ensuring long-term support and stability.
- **Performance**: Lit offers slightly better performance for micro-interactions due to its minimal abstraction layer and direct DOM manipulation.
- **Simplicity**: Lit's API is closer to vanilla web components, making the code more readable and easier to understand.
- **Flexibility**: Works well with any design system or CSS framework, providing more integration options.
- **Reliability**: Multiple case studies showed companies switching from Stencil back to Lit due to Stencil's reportedly stalled development and less extensive community support.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Better support for scenarios where JavaScript might fail or be disabled.

### Decision 2: Adopting Open WC Best Practices

**Context:**
We needed a consistent set of standards and tools to ensure our web component development follows industry best practices.

**Options Considered:**
- Creating our own development standards
- Following Open WC recommendations
- Using framework-specific standards

**Decision:**
Adopt Open WC best practices regardless of our component library choice.

**Rationale:**
- Provides ready-made testing utilities compatible with Lit
- Offers project scaffolding that can be adapted for our needs
- Recommends modern bundling techniques for optimal loading
- Emphasizes web standards which browsers optimize for
- Community-driven practices that have been refined over time

### Decision 3: Using Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Context:**
We needed a styling approach that would work efficiently with web components and support rapid UI development.

**Options Considered:**
- Traditional CSS/SCSS
- CSS-in-JS solutions
- Tailwind CSS
- Component-specific styling frameworks

**Decision:**
Adopt Tailwind CSS for component styling.

**Rationale:**
- **Component Compatibility**: Tailwind's utility-first approach works well with Shadow DOM encapsulation in web components
- **Development Speed**: Enables rapid UI development without context switching between files
- **Consistency**: Provides a constrained design system that ensures visual consistency
- **Performance**: Can be optimized to include only used styles, resulting in smaller CSS bundles
- **Responsiveness**: Built-in responsive design utilities align with our need for multi-device support
- **Theming**: Supports theming capabilities that may be useful for different game states or user preferences
- **Integration**: Works well with Lit's template literal styling approach

## Next Actions

1. Set up initial project structure using Open WC scaffolding (High priority)
2. Configure Tailwind CSS integration with Lit components (High priority)
3. Define user stories to guide our implementation (High priority)
4. Create first component test cases following TDD approach (Medium priority)
5. Implement basic state management pattern for the game (Medium priority)
