## Current Status

As the AI assisting Ryan, I observed him making significant progress in implementing connection link viewing and management within the `ConnectionListComponent`. His adherence to established patterns, such as the Result pattern for error handling and Lit's reactive properties for state management, ensured a robust implementation.

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Missing Service Method for Connection Link Retrieval

Ryan identified that the `ConnectionService` lacked a method for retrieving existing connection links, which was essential for the component's functionality.

**Resolution:** I suggested extending the `ConnectionService` to include a method for retrieving connection links. Ryan implemented this change, which resolved the issue and enabled the component to function as intended.

### Challenge 2: Toggling Link Display without Affecting Component State

Ryan faced challenges in managing the display of connection links without disrupting other component states or interactions.

**Resolution:** I recommended using conditional rendering with reactive properties to manage the display state. Ryan adopted this approach, which ensured proper state synchronization and a seamless user experience.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Extending Service Functionality

**Context:** Ryan needed to decide whether to extend the `ConnectionService` or implement a workaround within the component.

**Options Considered:**
- Extend the `ConnectionService` to include link retrieval functionality.
- Implement a workaround within the component.

**Decision:** Ryan chose to extend the service, which I supported. This decision aligns with best practices for maintaining a clean and modular codebase. I also recommended documenting the new service method to ensure consistency across the team.
