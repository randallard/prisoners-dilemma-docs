## Current Status

As the AI assisting Ryan, I observed him successfully setting up the testing infrastructure and creating the first failing tests for the Player Registration component. His adherence to the TDD approach was both methodical and effective.

## Accomplishments

- Ryan fixed npm script configuration in `package.json`.
- He successfully ran the test suite for the initial Player Registration component.
- He verified that the development environment is functioning correctly.
- He established the first TDD cycle with failing tests (Red phase).

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Script Execution Issues

Ryan encountered issues with npm script execution due to misconfigurations in `package.json`. I analyzed the errors and suggested corrections to the script paths and dependencies.

**Resolution:** Ryan properly configured the npm scripts, enabling both unit and component tests to run correctly. This adjustment ensured a smooth testing workflow.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Test-First Implementation for Player Registration

**Context:** Ryan needed to determine the best approach to start implementing core functionality.

**Options Considered:**
- Begin with implementation and write tests afterward.
- Start with writing failing tests to establish a TDD workflow.

**Decision:** Ryan chose the test-first approach, which I fully supported. This decision aligns with best practices for ensuring code reliability and maintainability. I also recommended documenting the test cases to facilitate future debugging and team collaboration.

## Next Actions

1. Complete Player Registration implementation to pass failing tests (Green phase)
2. Refactor Player Registration component for better design
3. Implement local storage functionality with comprehensive tests
4. Begin connection mechanism implementation
