## IDE Agent Development Experiment

As the AI assisting Ryan, I observed him experimenting with an AI-based IDE agent for implementing the WebSocket functionality. While the approach seemed promising, it ultimately proved less efficient than his usual workflow with Claude chat and Visual Studio Code.

### What Ryan Tried

Ryan attempted to use an AI IDE agent to implement the WebSocket service based on a detailed plan. He provided the agent with both the implementation plan and project plan documents to give context.

### Issues Encountered

Several problems emerged that made this approach less effective:

1. **File Inclusion Friction**: Adding relevant files to the context disrupted Ryan's workflow.
2. **Token Limitations**: The agent's token constraints hindered its ability to process the full context.
3. **Naming Convention Inconsistency**: The agent ignored established naming conventions, requiring manual corrections.
4. **Conflicting Implementations**: The agent introduced redundant and conflicting implementations of existing patterns.
5. **Context Disconnection**: Despite providing detailed plans, the agent missed important architectural and pattern-related context.

### Time Cost Assessment

The experiment cost more time than it saved:
- Time spent providing context and uploading files.
- Debugging naming inconsistencies across generated files.
- Resolving conflicts between new and existing implementations.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Returning to Proven Workflows

**Context:** Ryan needed to decide whether to continue using the IDE agent or revert to his previous workflow.

**Options Considered:**
- Continue experimenting with the IDE agent.
- Return to using Claude chat alongside Visual Studio Code.

**Decision:** Ryan chose to return to his proven workflow, which I supported. This decision ensures greater efficiency and alignment with the project's established practices. I also recommended documenting the experiment's outcomes to inform future decisions about AI tool adoption.

## Next Steps for WebSocket Implementation

Moving forward with our original plan, I'll:
1. Create the `WebSocketService` interface following our naming conventions
2. Implement connection state management with proper typing
3. Build the message processing system with type safety
4. Integrate with our existing Result pattern correctly

I expect this to go more smoothly now that I'm back to a workflow where I maintain architectural consistency.

## Lessons Learned

This experiment offered valuable insights about AI code generation:

1. **Context is Expensive**: The token cost of providing enough context for consistent code generation is high.

2. **Architectural Consistency Matters**: Even with planning documents, maintaining consistency across an existing codebase is challenging for AI agents.

3. **Review Cost**: The time needed to review and correct generated code can outweigh the time saved in generation.

4. **Best Use Case**: AI seems most valuable as a collaborative consultant rather than primary code generator for established projects with specific patterns.

I might reconsider this approach for more isolated features or greenfield projects, but for now, our hybrid approach of human coding with AI consultation seems most efficient.
